 <h2>The Best 3 Spots of All-time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Blue Chair</h3>
 <p>The dogs do not get on the blue chair. Its soft and high enough to see everything</p>

 <h3>The Back of the Couch</h3>
 <p>Everyone hangs out in the living. This is the spot to interact with the family</p>

 <h3>The Kitchen Table</h3>
<p>This is the ultimate spot. There is food there plus a large window!</p>
